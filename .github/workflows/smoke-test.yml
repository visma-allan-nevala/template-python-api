# =============================================================================
# Smoke Test Workflow
# =============================================================================
# Runs quick verification tests against deployed environments.
# Can be triggered manually or after deployments.
#
# LLM Instructions:
# - Configure API_BASE_URL for each environment
# - Add API_KEY secret if authentication is required
# - Extend smoke tests in tests/smoke/ as needed
# - This workflow verifies deployments are healthy
